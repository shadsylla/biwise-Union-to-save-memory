the goal is to diffrentiate the neurons pulses from each other.
Because I believe they must be a specturum, they can't be  a boolean logic.
They probably are a range of activity.

initiate:
Int Vector [3,4,5] electrode 44;
senses a active neuron x2 in a milisecond.
He should alert us.
finding some diferrentiation is key in this program.

Electrodes will have 3 parts depending on how deep they are in the brain.
I will call them:
   _deep_a
   _deep_b
   _deep_c

Part of the electrode will give us of the activity depending on
how deep.
We will measure time, space(profundity), and strength.

Questions to be asked:
- Does the speed inform us of anything?
- Does speed of a pusle of electricity traveling the axons into a synapse
 mean anything?
 - How can this code help us using The powers of C lang
 to measure exactly how fast things are moving inside?
 - The Cell body( Soma ) how can her study tell us the overall
 process of the brain?
 - how can we study the diffrent kinds of cells in the brain?
 - Is there any benefit in digging to the atomic level?
  _ what can quarks inside of protons and neutrons in an atom tell uus
  about our mission?
